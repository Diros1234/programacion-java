# The famous exercise of philosopher

In this exercise imagine that there are four philosophers on a table.

Each philosopher have two forks, but these forks are shared with the others philosophers.

With this analysis we can imagine that this program is probably that enter in deep-lock,this deep-lock consist of the moment a one philosopher has his fork and he want give the other fork but this other fork is caught for other philosopher...
if the other philosopher is in the same situation the program enter in deep lock,any philosopher will free his fork.

For solve this problem we can use syncronized function and others strategies.
